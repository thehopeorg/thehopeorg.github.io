Lekh-lekha Portion: How many potential members has Israel?

2010-03-12-appendix-3-c-lekh-lekha-portion-how-many-potential-members-has-israel


The Haftarah for the Lekh-lekha portion refers to Abraham as encouragement to beget the world's leading, and even largest, nation. From this perspective we survey the numbers that appear in the Parashah and find that the Twelve-fold Nation of Israel is potentially the largest of all nations.

# How many Potential Members

### Does the Nation of Israel have?

The Torah portion (_Parashah_, which is read publicly on the Saturday) of **Lekh-lekha** (Gen. 12:1-17:27) has many events: 1) the command to Avram to go to the Land, 2) Avram's descent to Egypt and the events between Avram, Saray and Pharaoh, 3) Avram's separation from Lot, 4) the war of the kings and Avram's victory, 5) the covenant by the divided offerings, 6) the birth of Yishmạ'el, and 7) the promise concerning Yitzḥaq (Isaac) and the covenant of circumcision. Each of these has gathered hips of exegeses.

Perhaps surprisingly, the Haftarah (section from the Books of the Prophets read after the _Parashah_) ties with the case of the kings, and this connection is only hinted – but from it we can learn more what the goal of the selection of Avram-Abraham was.

This Haftarah is from Isaiah (40:27- 41:16) and it is addressed to Israel: "But thou, Yisra'el, art my servant, Ya'ạqov whom I have chosen, the seed of Avraham my friend" (40:8). This is, in fact, the only mention of Avraham in the Haftarah, and even here not by a direct mention – but the mention that Ya'ạqov was of Avraham's seed, and Ya'ạqov (and not Abraham) is the founder of the Nation of Israel. Clearly, this is not for this mention that the Haftarah was selected.

But the Haftarah contains a verse that, though it does not name Avraham explicitly, does hint at him: "who raised up one from the east whom righteousness met wherever he set his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings…" (41:2). Who is that 'man of righteousness' who came from the East and overcame rules and kings? According to Genesis, this was Avram-Avraham, who started his journey from Ur-Kasdim in the East and overcame the four kings. The Haftarah gathers the meanings of the events of the _Parashah_ of _Lekh lekhah_ in order to give the nation of Israel confidence and credence. The trials of Avraham are a model for the situation of the People of Israel, and the connection concerns military and foreign affairs.

The successful contention of Avram with the kings does not resemble his contention with Pharaoh, an affair that gave Avram riches, but not honor (the man of righteousness and generosity in this Parashah is in fact Pharaoh). It is also not only the contention with the four kings of the East but with ten kings – the four kings, the five local kings who were also wicked (see Rashi's interpretation of their names) as well as with the mysterious figure or "Malkitzedek king of Shalem… a priest of the Highest God" (Gen. 14:18). Here is was Avram who acts with justice and generosity; he relinquished his share of the great booty, whereas to the priest-king he gave "a tithe of everything". This can be interpreted as a tithe from the booty, but it is also possible to understand as a tithe from everything that Avram had – in thus perhaps penance for the riches he gained by delivering his wife to Pharaoh.

The number Ten returns later in the Covenant In-Between the Pieces, in which Avram received the fourth of the seven divine promises that he received in the Parashah of Lekh-lekha. His seed is promised to receive the country of ten nations: the Qeny, Qenizzi, Qadmony, Ḥitti, Perizzi, the Refa'im, the Emori, Kena'ạni, Girgashi and Yevusi. (Interestingly, of all these ten peoples, the Parashah counts only "and the Kena'ạni and the Perizzi then in the land" (Gen. 13:7), and does not mention these other nations, and in other lists of the people of Kena'ạn only six or seven nations are mentioned.)

In the course of the portion, another number is mentioned – 318. These three hundred and eighteen were "his trained servants, born in his own house" (14:14), yet not his biological sons (as the overall theme of the Parashah is the sterility of Avram and Saray). When he was circumcised, he was already "Avraham" (meaning "father of multitudes") he also "took Yishma'el his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Avraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin" (17:20) - which obviously included those 318.

Another important number that appears in the Parashah is included in the blessing for Ishmael – even though he would not be included in the blessings to Yitzḥaq: "And as for Yishmạ'el, I have heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly, twelve princes (_nesi'im_) shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation" (17:20). This blessing for a nation of twelve parties, which was first given to Yishmạ'el, would later be given also to Abraham's grandson, Ya'ạqov-Israel.

The Haftarah brings Abraham as a model for Israel, because of two reasons – his military daring and his belief (albeit shaky at times) that he – old and childless as he was - will still have offspring as numerous as the sand of the earth and the stars in the heavens.

From this, there issue a few conclusions concerning the Nation of Israel as the Servant of God - which is also "a Servant Nation"8 for all humankind – as it is written in the beginning of the Parashah "in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed" (12:3).

At present, as in the time of Isaiah, we are under the feeling that we are a small nation that comprises solely of "The Jewish People" (_Ạm Yisra'el_), whose survival is under threat. The mention of Abraham in these Parashah and Haftarah come to give encourage to Israel. Israel is not an exclusively the nation of Jews, but a twelve-part nation whose components identify themselves with the promises to Abraham. The picturesque promise of "look now towards heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count them; and he said to him, so shall thy seed be" (15:5). This count is not so clear mathematically – does it concern only the stars seen with naked eyes (a few thousands), or the number of stars in the galaxy (tens of billions) or in all the billions of galaxies (possibly more than all the grains of sand upon earth, 12:16). A more precise estimate is contained in the hope of Moshe (Moses) for the People of Israel "The Lord your God has multiplied you, and, behold, you are this day like the stars of heaven for multitude. The Lord God of your fathers may add to you a thousand times so many as you are, and bless you, as He has promised you" (Deut. 1:10-11). About 600,000 men who exited from Egypt multiplied by thousand means well over 600 million - and since these 600,000 included only combat-age men, the total actually reaches some two billion (also, if we calculate the over 6 million contemporary Israeli Jews times 318 of joiners - as in the case of Abraham and his household - we get about two billion). Clearly such a Nation of Israel is not identified with only "The Jewish People", but includes much beyond that, the potential is among all the people who are affected by the message of the Hebrew Bible.
