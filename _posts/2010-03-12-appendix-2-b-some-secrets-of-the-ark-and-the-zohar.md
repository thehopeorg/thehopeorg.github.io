### **Connections between the Ark and the Tabernacle**

some-secrets-of-the-ark-and-the-zohar


The building of Noaḥ's Ark, thought the Sages, parallels not only the Creation of the World, but also the building of the Tabernacle and the Temple of Jerusalem.

Let us recall the specific commands that Noaḥ received: "Make thee an ark of Gofer wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion of which thou shalt make it; the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window (Ẓohar) shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side; with lower, second and third stories shalt thou make it" (6:14-16). That is, the thirty cubits of the height of the ark were divided to three stories, likely equal in height, namely: each story ten cubits high.

The most significant and canonical building mentioned in the Torah was the building of the Tabernacle. We have shown that, compared with 34 verses that were required for the Torah to describe all the works of Creation, the description of the Tabernacle and its construction required 256 (4\*\*4) verses. "Issues of Torah are poor at their place and rich in another place" (_Tosafot, Kritut_ page 14a). By comparing with the pattern of the Tabernacle and its construction we might understand better the matter of the ark:

1. The proportions of the long and narrow ark are reminiscent of the Planks of the Tabernacle. These planks were of 10 x 1.5 x 1 cubits, whereas the Ark had the size of 300 x 50 x 30 cubits, that is a proportion of 10:1.67:1 cubit (the difference between 1.67 and 1.5 can be explained by the need to use whole or simple numbers to describe building elements).

2. The floor plan of the ark – three hundred by fifty cubits – contains three times the yard of the Tabernacle: hundred by fifty cubits (Exodus 27:19).

3. The basic module of the Tabernacle is the cube of 10 x 10 x 10 cubits of the Holy of Holies. All the measures of the Ark are multiples of 10, so that it is possible to divide the ark to the module of the Tabernacle. The entire space of the ark contains 450 such modules (300 x 50 x 30 cubits) – which are ten times **Ad** a **m** by Gematria, a motive we shall return to.

4. The image (**Ẓ**_e_**l**_e_**m**) of Adam – and the Image of He in whose Image and likeness was Adam formed – the Image of God – is also made of three stories: the top one parallels the head (brain), the middle one parallels the chest (heart), and the lower one parallels the belly (liver – **K**_a_**v**_e_**d**). This is much like the ark, whose top floor presumably served for the dwelling of the humans (the brain), the middle floor served the dwellings of the animals (the heart of the mission) whereas the bottom floor served for utilities and food stores (the liver and belly) and the collection (and perhaps recycling) of wastes. The Tabernacle (and the Temple that derived from it) allows seeing a similar division: the measures of the Tabernacle edifice were 30 x 10 x 10 cubits, which derive from the addition of the Holy of Holies (whose form, as noted, is cubical) and the Holy (**Qod** _e_ **s** _h_, and in the Temple, the **H**_e_**ik**_ha_**l**), whose form is of a box (Exodus 26:33). This Holy, whose measure (at Solomon's Temple) is the measure of two Ark stories, parallels the belly and the chest (and the seven lower Sefirot), and the Holy of Holies parallels the head (and the three higher Sefirot). The assignment of places in the ark recalls the four degrees of being according to the Kabbalah – mineral, vegetal, animal and verbal (namely humans) and Judah haLevi, in his book "the Kuzari", adds another degree – the "prophetic", which is the potential degree of the people of Israel. The mineral in the ark served the construction material, the (stored) vegetal matches the lower floor, the animal match the middle floor and the verbal match the higher floor – where the glazed Tzohar at the ceiling of the ark symbolizes the flow of prophecy.

5. Another connection, this time semantic and not numeric, is between this **T**_e_**v**_a_**h** -Ark and the "the Ark of the Covenant" that the Tablets of the Covenant were laid in, and the temporary heir to the Tabernacle and the Temple – namely the Synagogue – where there is also laid a Torah scroll inside an "Ark".

So, a Torah is housed in a **T**_e_**v**_a_**h**-Ark, same with the five Books of Moses in the synagogue Ark

The Ark of Noaḥ, the ark/box of papyrus of Moses and the sacred Ark inside any synagogue pertain to the same pattern.

**2. The Ark and the Tzohar**

There is one element in Noaḥ's Ark that it is not clear whether it is functional or symbolic (or both), which is the Tzohar). As **N**oa**ḥ** was told: "A window - Tzohar – shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it above" (Gen. 6:16). These are somewhat obscure words and the interpreters have proposed several explanations. Rashi posits two possibilities: "Some say window and some say a precious stone that gives them light" (as also in Midrash Bereshit Raba). Ibn Ẹzra explains "Tzohar" as "a place through which the light enters, and is a derivative of Tzohorayim" (noontime – that is, the time that the sunlight equally to the East and to the West). Whereas Rabenu Beḥaye explains that this was a precious stone called _Bareqet_ (Carbuncle) that was used in the Ḥoshen (the High Priest's breast plate) for the Tribe of Levi and which the prophet called "Eqdaḥ", is it was said "And I will make thy windows (of the New Jerusalem) of rubies, and thy gates of Eqdaḥ (beryl) stones, and all thy borders of choicest stones" (Isaiah 54:12). The objection among the interpreters to the explanation that it is the window is that a window one cubit long would not suffice to light up a closed ark 300 cubits long, so that there must have been other windows.

A Ḥassidic interpretation that adds and builds upon the explanation of the Ba'ạl Shem Tov that the Tevah (Ark) is the word of prayer, is from Rabbi Elimelekh, that it merits the person praying that the prayer word that issues from the mouth shall be as beautiful as the precious stone of the Tzohar. Such Ḥassidic interpretations accord with the modern Hebrew meaning of "**Ẓ**o**h**a**r**" as " **H**a**ẓh**a**r**a**h**", namely an obligating statement of principle.7

It is clear that the Tzohar has to do with light – and especially with a light called "Zohar", about which it was prophesied "And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness (Zohar) of the firmament" (Daniel 12:3) and in greater detail in Ezekiel, "And I Then I beheld , and lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from what appeared to be his loins downward, fire; and from his loins upward, as it were the appearance of brightness (Zohar), something like electrum (**Ḥ**_a_**s**_h_**m**_a_**l** – the modern Hebrew word for electricity) (8:2). The Tzohar is connected with the precious stone of the tribe of Levi and therefore with the functions of the Tabernacle and the Temple. It is possible to associate the story of the incarcerated in an ark with just one window to Plato's "parable of the Cave", according to which people see only the "reflected light" – they do not perceive the reality but only its shadows.

Likewise, the Kabbalah makes distinction between "Or Yashar" (direct light), which is the original light, and "Or Ḥozer" (reflected light) by which we observe the different objects, and the direct light is the better.[2] It may be said that Plato's "parable of the Cave" actually asserts that our deficiency as humans is in being bound through the physical (3D) world to see only reflected light and not the original direct light. And here the quality and the function of the Ẓohar of the ark (whether as a window or a precious stone) is to transfer the direct light into the dark cavern of the ark, which is like the belly of the whale of Jonah.

Habitually we see only light reflected from objects and not the original light. Nowadays we are moving from learning and observation of reflected light to those of direct light. Looking at TV and computer screens, at which millions of people spend many hours, we observe emitted light (Or Yoẓe). The letters, pictures and visual patterns that appear to each person off the computer screen are made of "direct light" that comes from the screen to the eye and brain of the reader, and not from reflected light off book pages. This has something of the quality of the appearance of the Torah "in black fire over a white fire".

It is a reasonable interpretation that the "Tzohar" means a decorated, stained glass window built from sections of colored glass and prisms (a general form of the cutting of precious stones) that creates a pattern of lights – whether figurative, abstract-geometrical or letters of light. Thus in this portion there is a premonition, perhaps prophetic, of an element that would become extremely important in temple architecture, including in the Dome of the Rock and in Gothic Cathedrals (which can be regarded as derivatives of the Dome of the Rock). The theoretician and pioneer of the stained glass windows was Suger, Abbot of St. Denis, who emphasized the quality of "Lux Continua", which is the divine light that contains and surrounds all. His objective was to form "walls of light" within the cathedral and thereby to reproduce the light of the Heavenly Jerusalem.

Suger wrote expressly that he invited artisans from Byzantium and from Moslem countries. Likewise, the Qabbalah makes distinction between "Or Yashar" (direct light), which is the original light, and "Or Ḥozer" (reflected light) by which we observe the different objects, and the direct light is the better.[2] It may be said that Plato's "parable of the Cave" actually asserts that our deficiency as humans is in being bound through the physical (3D) world to see only reflected light and not the original direct light. And here, the quality and the function of the Ẓohar of the ark (whether as a window or a precious stone) is to transfer the direct light into the dark cavern of the ark, which is like the belly of the whale of Jonah.

Habitually we see only light reflected from objects and not the original light. Nowadays we are moving from learning and observation of reflected light to those of direct light. Looking at TV and computer screens, at which millions of people spend many hours, we observe emitted light (Or Yotẓe). The letters, pictures and visual patterns that appear to each person off the computer screen are made of "direct light" that comes from the screen to the eye and brain of the reader, and not from reflected light off book pages. This has something of the quality of the appearance of the Torah "in black fire over a white fire".

Gothic architecture presented the possibility of building actual shrines of light. Nowadays technology allows the building of entire structures of steel that are mainly glazing, such as the Geodesic Domes of Buckminster Fuller, including his vision to build a dome that would form a ball of lights that presents the whole planet earth and its various trends as patterns of light points. In the Revelation of John that concludes the Christian Bible there is a vision of "the Sea of Glass" over Jerusalem, upon which there take place epiphanies of the Messiah among 24 Elders of Israel.

Notes:
[1] One should note the wonderful article of the RaShaZ, the Alte Rebbe about "_vesamti Kodkod shimshotayikh_" (And I will make thy windows of rubies) see Liqute Torah for Re'eh, pages 24d-29a, that render what is mentioned here and more, in greater depth and extension.

[2] The Kabbalah and Kabbalah scholarship literature about light is immense. Much treatment of the subject may be found in Moshe Idel's "Absorbing Perfections".

This concept is examined in detail by the Maharal, _Be'er haGolah_ V3, 12

The chapters in the Bible where later, Christian divisions and they do not oblige the Jewish reading. Many portions (_Parashot_) start or end in the middle of a chapter.

- The claim that Israel, and specifically Zion, are the Nation of God and co-creators with Him of the New Heavens and New Earth is given clearly in the introduction to the (book of) Zohar.

The Hebrew word for both "spirit" and "wind" (and also direction) is **Ru**'a **ḥ**. The **Ru**'a **ḥ** moves within the 3-dimensional space, which is symbolized by the Hebrew letter **W**'aw (**ו**), whose numerical value is 6 and is used to signify the six main directions of the 3D space. Thus, there is "a storm wind (**Ru**'a **ḥ**) coming out of the north" (Ezekiel 1:4), and also "Come from the four winds (**Ru**' **ḥot**), O spirit (**Ru**'a **ḥ**) and breathe upon those slain, that they may live" (Ez. 37:9). But we also learn from Elijah "And He said, Go out, and stand upon the mountain before the Lord (YHWH) And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind (**Ru**'a **ḥ**) rent the mountain and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wond (**Ru**'a **ḥ**); and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice"(1 Kings 19:11) – only when the whole noise {which derives from the mental state of the prophesier} rests, then the spirit lands to rest.

7For example, the Revisionist-Ẓionist leader Ze'ev Zabotinsky, who was a poet and an artist of the Hebrew language, called for a new (re-)vision of Ẓionism and named the movement "Brit ha **Tz** o **h** a **r**" as an acronym of " **h** _a_ **Ẓ\*\*** ionut **\_ \_** h **_a_** R **_e_** visionisti\*\*_t_"

8 The term "Servant Nation" was coined by Hugh Schonfield; see Appendix 1-D - The Servant Nation in the Haphtarah of the Genesis portion.
